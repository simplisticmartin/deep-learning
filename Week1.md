# Deep learning course by deeplearning Ai.

Finished the first week. Working on the second week. Stuff to reiterate.
First take of the quiz of week 1 I recieved an 80, not good enough will retake. But I will pace my self to reinforce the knowledge.

Supervised and unsupervised data.
Supervised is training data with labels and unsupervised learning does not

So Stuff being talked about are things such as using Relu as opposed to traditional learning algos. Relu stands for rectified Unit Linear Unit. Rectified meaning a maximum of 0.

Neural networks are based off human anatomy like the brain. Networks are like: 
taking factors and combining them with different combinations (personal take first week interpretation, note this may be wrong. I will come back to this and rectify this if I am wrong.)

Traditional NN, Recurrent NN, Convolutional NN 
examples? advertisements and stuff, speech recognition, machine translation and of course 

a custom NN is something like autonomous driving cars

structured data is stuff you see in database tables.
columns and rows of data.

unstructured data is stuff
like images, audio and text.

So traditional algos perform good
but small neural networks with good amount of data performs better
the bigger the neural networks, the better the performance gets. The more data we can have the better we perform. Before this, algos couldn't take advantage of all of this.
